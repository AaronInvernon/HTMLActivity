                    <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
                    <p>
                        Litterin a dark and a dreadry road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
                        incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
                        efforts
                        of folk like the <span>W3C</span>, <span>WaSP</span>, and
                        the major brower creators.

                    <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is a continuing need to show the power of Css. The Zen Garden
                        aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some
                        of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style
                        sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that
                        has changed isd the external CSS file. Yes, really.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CSS allows complete complete and total control over the style of hypertext
                        document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people
                        excited is by demostrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed
                        in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and
                        coders alikehace contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always
                        push it further.

                    <p>
                        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying This
                        page, so strong <span>CSS</span> skills are necessary too, but the example files are
                        commented well enough that even <span>CSS</span> novices can use them as starting
                        points. Please see the <a>CSS Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and
                        tips on working with <span>CSS</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML.
                        This may seem daunting at first if yoyu've never worked this way before,
                        but follow the listed Ã±links to learn more, and use the sample files as a
                        guide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Download the sample <a>HTML</a> and <a href="#">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you
                        have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit half-finished
                        work) upload your <span>CSS</span> file to a web server under your control. <a href="#">Send us
                            a link</a> to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we
                        choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.
